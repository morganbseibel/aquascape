<h2>History</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have been putting aquatic plants and fish together in aquariums forever. However, aquascaping is a relatively new art. There are a few popular styles of planted tanks and the oldest, the Dutch style, emerged in the 1930s. The Dutch style design rarely uses hardscape materials like rocks or driftwood. Dutch style aquascapes are packed with a variety of colorful plants, showing almost no substrate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other popular design styles include the Japanese Nature Aquarium style, Japanese Iwagumi style and the Jungle style. The Nature Aquarium style was developed by aqua designer Takashi Amano in the 1990s. Aquascapes with this style mimic natural landscapes, have a focus point and are often minimalist. They use hardscape materials and less colors than the Dutch style. In the Iwagumi style, rocks dominate the aquascape and low-growing plants are usually used. In the Jungle style, there is dense plant growth resembling a jungle. Hardscape materials are rarely used and plants are meant to densely fill this aquascape.</p>

He has incorporated ecosystem and other elements found in nature to aquatic plant layout and established his own unique style called “Nature Aquarium”. In 1982, Amano founded Aqua Design Amano. The company attracted much attention for its aquarium equipment “Nature Aquarium Goods” featuring excellent quality and design." -Aqua Design Amano

"The Green Machine is a flagship in the art of aquascaping. Aquascaping itself is simply creating what is intrinsically a small section of tropical riverbank within the confines of your own home.

The emphasis of these art works is on the beautiful landscape created within an aquarium, with the onus on the beauty and harmony of nature." -<a href="http://www.thegreenmachineonline.com/about-us/" target="_blank">The Green Machine</a>
