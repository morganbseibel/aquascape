<h2>How-To: Build an aquascape</h2>
<p><i>Starting an aquascape only requires a few materials and tools. Here are the basic steps to creating an aquascape:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step 1:</b> Gather basic materials and tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before you begin constructing your aquascape, do research and come up with a design plan and list of materials you will need for your tank. Make sure to chose a tank size, pick the best substrate(s), filter and light for your plan, set up an appropriate tank stand that will hold the weight of your tank and gather other necessary materials. These include:</p>
<p><i>Glass tank</i></p>
<p><i>Tank stand</i></p>
<p><i>Substrate</i></p>
<p><i>Planting tongs</i></p>
<p><i>Filter</i></p>
<p><i>Light</i></p>
<p><i>Plants</i></p>
<p><i>*See <a href="supplies.html">Supplies</a> page for more information on lights, filters and other materials.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Pick a tank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When picking a tank, consider:</p>
<p><i>How many gallons do you want it to hold?</i></p>
<p><i>What are your ideal dimensions?</i></p>
<p><i>Do you want a rimless or rimmed tank?</i></p>
<p>Then, purchase (or build) a tank to fit your criteria.</p>
<p><b>*Tip:</b> Water test your tank after purchasing by placing the tank outside (in non-freezing temperatures) on a towel, filling it with water and leaving it for 24 hours. Check periodically for leaks!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step 3:</b> Lay down substrate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a cup or bowl to scoop the substrate out of its original bag and pour into the tank. Use the substrate to create a landscape with hills and shallows that fits your design plan. Make sure to keep your substrate layer thick enough for plants to root down into. The necessary thickness varies with each plant, but most deep-rooted plants need <b>2-3 inches</b> of substrate. <b>*Tip:</b> Build the substrate up higher in the back of your tank. This creates depth and gives your background plants' roots more space to grow.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step 4:</b> Add decorations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Place rocks and/or driftwood in your tank and push lightly into the substrate to secure. Before moving on to the next step, <b>make sure</b> you are happy with your design.</p>

</div>
<p><b>*Tip:</b> Make sure all the rocks and pieces of driftwood you use are treated for aquariums or are naturally aquarium safe! Untreated materials can lower or raise your tank's pH level and seep other chemicals, which can harm your plants and fish.</p>
<p><b>*Tip:</b> Rocks and/or driftwood usually draw attention and are the focus point in an aquascape. Keep that in mind when designing your aquascape! To ensure you are happy with your design, add decorations then <b>wait</b> 24 hours. This gives you the opportunity to make easy changes with the decorations and design if you change your mind about something.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step 5:</b> Add water.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Carefully</b> and slowly add water to your tank. There are a few methods for carefully adding water:</p>
<p><i>Use a bowl to move water into the tank and slowly pour over one area.</i></p>
<p><i>Use a hose (must have slow water flow) and hold it against the glass so the water flows down the side of the tank.</i></p>
<p><i>Hold a hose at the bottom of your tank in one area and slowly fill.</i></p>
<p><b>*Tip:</b> Go slow and be careful so you do not stir up the substrate or damage your landscape. Once your tank is filled, use planting tongs to fix any damages to your landscape.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step 6:</b> Add plants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose aquatic plants for your tank and decide where in your tank you will plant them. Usually, different plants are used in the background, middle-ground and foreground to create an illusion of depth:</p>
<p><i>Background:</i> Use tall, large plants. <b>*Tip:</b> Plants that are bushy or have large leaves fill out the background best.</p>
<p><i>Middle-ground</i> Use medium-height and medium-sized plants.</p>
<p><i>Foreground:</i> Use short, carpeting plants with small leaves. These plants should stay low to the ground and be the smallest plants in your tank. You can also choose not to use any plants in the foreground.</p>
<p>Divide plant packs/bundles of plants into small clumps with roots pointing in one direction using small scissors or your fingers. Then, using planting tongs or chop sticks, grab these clumps by the roots and stick them into the substrate where you want them to grow. Slowly release your grip on the tongs/chopsticks and remove them, leaving the plant behind in your substrate. For the most even plant growth, remember to evenly spread out clumps in their designated area. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Step 7:</b> Cycle water.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Add your light and filter. Make sure your light is on a maximum of 8 hours per day and your filter is always running. With good lighting and a filter, your plants will start to grow. The water should be cycled, however, to balance its bacteria and chemicals and prepare it for fish. This could take 2-12 weeks, depending on your method. There are many ways to cycle the water, like:</p>
<p><i>Fishless cycle:</i> Add chemicals like ammonia and nitrates.</p> 
<p><i>Fish cycle:</i> After 1-3 days, add a few hardy fish. Only add 1-1.5 fish per 10 gallons. These fish will aid the cycling process with their waste. Feed them sparingly and at the end of the cycle, do water swaps every few days with about 10% of your tank's water.</p>
<p><i>Natural cycle:</i> Do quarter-tank water swaps every few days and aid plant growth (like with CO2). In this method, plants are the only thing balancing the water, so it is slower and requires a heavily planted tank.</p>

</div>
<p><b>*Tip:</b> You can also add a CO2 system to aid plant growth.</p>

</div>
<p><b>*Tip:</b> There are many methods and combinations of methods for cycling tanks. Do your research and create a method that works best for you and your tank!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step 8:</b> Add fish.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your tank is established, you can add fish. Your tank is established once your water is safe for fish and plants are moderately grown in. You can test your water by taking it to a pet store or buying a water test kit.</p> 
<p><b>*Tip:</b> Remember not to overcrowd your tank with too many fish. You can look up the right amount (and type) of fish to keep in your size tank, but a basic rule to follow is one inch per gallon. That means you can add one inch of fish per one gallon. You can always look up a fish's full size before purchasing. Example: Following the one inch per gallon rule, you could add 10 2-inch tetras in a 20 gallon tank.</p> 
<p><b>*Tip:</b> Remember that with aquascapes, scale and style matters. So, pick fish that fit the size of your tank. And to really enhance your tank, pick fish with colors that complement your plants!</p>
