<h2>Participants</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first evaluator was <b>Will Dunn</b>, a Rolla student and beginning aquascaper. He used a Google Chrome on a custom built PC with 8GB RAM, nVidia GTX 970, i5 3750k OC @ 4.1 GHz when evaluating my website. He recently found out about aquascaping. It sparked his interest, so he has been doing research about it. Because my website is meant to lay down the basics of aquascaping and meant for beginning aquascapers, Will was the perfect evaluator. He is definitely an end user because he is just getting started with aquascaping. He also has knowledge of other aquascaping resources because he has been doing research lately, so he could compare my website to those other resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second evaluator was <b>Patrick Burridge</b> using Google Chrome on a Macbook Pro and DSL internet connection. I have known him for a long time and I chose him to evaluate my website because he has a lot of first-hand knowledge about and personal experiences with aquascaping. Him and his roommate keep multiple aquascapes and have built glass tanks together. He has a good amount of knowledge about building aquascapes, maintaining them, transporting them, keeping fish, visiting pet stores and other aspects of aquascaping. Because of these reasons, I thought Patrick would be a great person to evaluate my website. He knows if I am being biased, using credible resources and information and presenting aquascaping in an accurate way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third evaluator was <b>Grant Waldemer</b> using Google Chrome on a Toshiba Satellite P75­A running Windows 10, Intel(R) Core i&­4700MQ CPU @ 2.40GHz, 8.00 GB RAM with AT&T U-Verse Wifi. I met him through some mutual friends and I decided to have him evaluate my website because he has done some research on aquascapes and keeps one himself. He built his aquascape and few months ago and keeps fish. He already has the knowledge beginners need to start an aquascape so he was able to see if my website has all the necessary information for beginners. He could also check my how-to steps and tips as he built his own aquascape. He has also done a lot of product research, so he was able to see if I mentioned the right supplies and provided visitors with the right resources. Because he has experience searching product and building and maintaining an aquascape, I thought he would be a great end user to evaluate my website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, my evaluators liked my website’s design. They said the website’s navigation was intuitive and browsing was easy. They also liked the color theme’s coordination with aquascapes and my images, and found the text easy-to-read. Patrick said the colors coordinate with natural plants and water, which was my goal. They liked the multimedia I used and found it valuable, but suggested adding more photos. For example, Will suggested I add pictures on the how-to page to break up all the text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My evaluators found my content to be in-depth, factual and accurate. Will said the content is informative and left him curious about aquascapes. All the links on my website worked for my evaluators and Will said they all serve a definite purpose. As well, my evaluators said I gave clear information from an unbiased standpoint. An avid aquascape artist himself, Grant said he learned from my website and got some new ideas for aquascaping. His feedback told me my website is serving its purpose of being an organized place to find aquascaping resources and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick said my website offered a lot of useful information and gave professional examples. He and the other evaluators also gave me high marks for credibility, however Will said some information is not cited/linked. Grant said my own experiences and credentials are not available, my credibility is implied.</p>
<h2>Evaluator Data</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are my evaluator's data files:</p>
<p><a href="WillDunn.pdf" target="_blank">Will Dunn</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="PatrickBurridgeEval.pdf" target="_blank">Patrick Burridge</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="GrantWaldemerEval.pdf" target="_blank">Grant Waldemer</a></p>
<h2>Planned Changes</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will condense the how-to page to be less wordy and have photos, as Will suggested. It is very text-heavy which can turn off visitors. Shortening the text will help free up the page. Photos will be visually appealing, break up the text-heavy page and make the steps easier for visitors to understand.</p>
<p>I will also add more photos throughout my website, as multiple evaluators suggested. The photos will be visual aides to visitors, helping them better understand the topic. They will also intrigue visitors, catching and hopefully keeping their attention so they stay on my website longer.</p>
<p>Finally, I will add some information about me as the website’s author to build credibility. I will share my own experience with aquascaping, where I got my information and why my website is reliable.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the evaluation pretty helpful. Each of my evaluators had different amounts of knowledge about aquascaping and different experiences with aquascaping. Will has done some research but does not keep tanks, Patrick has personal experience with aquascapes because he lives with someone who keeps four of them, and Grant has done research and keeps an aquascape himself. This variety in knowledge allowed for feedback coming from all sides. Their responses helped me understand how useful my website was for different people with different levels of aquascaping knowledge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, their evaluations helped me understand the most helpful information on my website. Their mix of design advice and content advice was also helpful. The changes I will make based on their feedback will consolidate my website’s content and make it more intriguing. The evaluation process was a simple way to find out what users want from my website and figure out what changes to make.</p>
